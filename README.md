// Won't be used anymore
Figure 16 and 17 (Weighted SOTA): Since we no longer will use weighted average we remowed them but they are in visualizations/chinese_dataset_visualizations/comparisons_student_based.ipynb in older version


## Notes
-- Mimis et al. Naive Bayes and Neural Network experiments are done on weka. Experiments with subset are not done yet on weka. Naive Bayes and Neural Network will be run on subset on weka.
-- Since ANHUI dataset has a brand new algorithm, all of the experiments are out-dated hence we removed them. But they are still present in older version.
